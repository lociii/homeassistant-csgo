## Alternative overwolf integration

I've built a new integration to support many more games through the Overwolf platform.

Search for "Overwolf Webhook" in HACS.

Source and support on https://github.com/lociii/homeassistant-overwolf-status and https://github.com/lociii/overwolf-homeassistant-webhook.

## Maintained fork

For all of you that still want to stick to the Counter-Strike only integration, please use the fork provided by `yeheskel2016` on https://github.com/yeheskel2016/homeassistant-csgo

# CS:GO game state integration for Home Assistant

## What is this about?

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an open source home automation and control system.

[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) is a tactical first person shooter by Valve Corporation

## What does it do?

This integration [listens to game state changes](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration) and fires relevant events in Home Assistant. These can then be used to change your lighting or start some fireworks :-)

Convert your desk into a big Counter-Strike tournament stage!

Please read [info.md](info.md) carefully to understand how this integration is set up and connected to your Counter-Strike client.

## How can I install it?

The easiest way to install the integration is by using [Home Assistant Community Store HACS](https://hacs.netlify.com/).
Just search for "csgo" and install the integration. Further instruction are shown in the integration description in HACS.
