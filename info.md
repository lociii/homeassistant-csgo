# !!!!! DEPRECATED !!!!!

I've built a new integration to support many more games through the Overwolf platform.

Search for "Overwolf Webhook" in HACS.

Source and support on https://github.com/lociii/homeassistant-overwolf-status and https://github.com/lociii/overwolf-homeassistant-webhook.

# CS:GO game state integration for Home Assistant

This integration makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive game state changes available in Home Assistant.

## Setup - Home Assistant

First make sure that your instance is reachable via URL. Go to `Configuration > Settings > General` and set `Internal URL` and `External URL`.

Then go to `Configuration > Devices and Services > Integrations`. Press the `Add integration` button and add the "CS:GO game state listener" integration.

During the setup process, the integration will create a webhook and show the URI parameter for the CS:GO configuration.
Make sure to copy this code to your clipboard.

## Setup - CS:GO

CS:GO has an [integrated game state reporting engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/cjhcpy/game_state_integration_a_very_large_and_indepth/) that we will use no update Home Assistant.

The configuration will be added to your CS:GO config directory.
[How to find my config directory](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration#Locating_CS:GO_Install_Directory)

Open that directory and add a file called **gamestate_integration_homeassistant.cfg**.

Add the following content and replace the "uri" with the one copied during the integration setup:

```
"HomeAssistant Integration v1.2.0"
{
 "uri" "https://hooks.nabu.casa/xyz"
 "timeout" "5.0"
 "buffer" "0.1"
 "throttle" "0.5"
 "heartbeat" "15.0"
 "data"
 {
   "round"          "1" // round phase, bomb state and round winner
   "player_state"   "1" // player state (used for health)
 }
}
```

## Events

When everything is set up properly, the integration will start firing events as game state changes happen.

The following events are currently supported:

### csgo_round_freeze

Freeze time before a round started

### csgo_round_started

New round started

### csgo_health_critical

### csgo_round_win_ct

### csgo_round_win_t

## Automations

Use these events to trigger automations that control your lights, sounds, fireworks, etc.

Have fun!
